-- error handling
   looking at this in general. Just took one example and I have doubts about the correctness.
   I do not understand how the error handling can work in AkkaHttpEndpoint.handle
   In my understanding, .foldError is never is executed in case of errror, because the whole Try (handler processing) is executed in .runAsync


-- fixed scaladoc
